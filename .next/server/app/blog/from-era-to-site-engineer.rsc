15:T7d4,## A Fresh Graduate's Dilemma

Tofunmi graduated with a B.Eng in Civil Engineering from the University of Lagos in 2024. Like many graduates, she had strong theoretical knowledge but limited practical experience.

> "I could solve structural analysis problems on paper, but I'd never set foot on a real construction site. I didn't know what a day in the life of a site engineer looked like."

## Discovering ERA

A friend who had completed ERA's programme recommended it. "She told me it was intense but worth every naira. She was already working on a major project in Victoria Island within two months of finishing."

## The ERA Experience

The first week was eye-opening. "We went to an active construction site on day three. I saw a foundation being cast for the first time. The instructor explained every step — the formwork, the reinforcement checks, the slump test, the pour sequence. It was nothing like the textbook."

Over the next six months, Tofunmi learned:
- Structural drawing interpretation
- Concrete volume calculation and material estimation
- Site supervision and quality control
- AutoCAD for civil engineering
- Professional communication and report writing

## The Placement

Through ERA's partner network, Tofunmi was placed with Calebella Integritas Projects Ltd for a three-month internship. "I was nervous, but ERA had prepared me well. Within the first week, I was assisting with setting out and supervising reinforcement placement."

## Where She Is Now

Tofunmi was offered a full-time position as a Site Engineer. She now supervises concrete works on a 5-storey residential development in Lekki.

> "ERA didn't just teach me engineering — they taught me how to be a professional. The mentorship, the site experience, the soft skills training — it all came together. I'm exactly where I want to be."

## Her Advice

"Don't wait for the perfect opportunity to fall in your lap. Invest in yourself. ERA gave me the foundation, and the rest was hard work and consistency."8:["$","$L13",null,{"children":["$","$L14",null,{"post":{"id":5,"slug":"from-era-to-site-engineer","title":"From ERA Graduate to Site Engineer: Tofunmi's Story","excerpt":"ERA Cohort 3 graduate Tofunmi shares her journey from a fresh civil engineering graduate to a confident site engineer.","content":"$15","category":"Success Stories","author":"ERA Editorial Team","authorAvatar":"/placeholder.svg","coverImage":"/placeholder.svg","date":"2026-03-01","tags":["success-story","civil-engineering","career","inspiration"],"published":true}}]}]
