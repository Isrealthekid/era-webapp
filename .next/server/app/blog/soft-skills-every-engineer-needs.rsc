15:T7d3,## Beyond Technical Competence

In the Nigerian construction industry, technical skills are the minimum requirement. What separates good engineers from great ones — and what determines who gets promoted — are soft skills.

We surveyed our 20+ partner companies to understand exactly which soft skills they value most.

## 1. Communication

Can you explain a structural issue to a non-technical client? Can you write a clear site report? Can you brief a foreman on the day's work without ambiguity?

Engineers who communicate clearly save projects time and money. Those who can't create confusion, rework, and delays.

## 2. Problem-Solving Under Pressure

Construction sites are unpredictable. Materials arrive late, weather disrupts schedules, designs need modification on the fly. Employers want engineers who can think on their feet and propose solutions, not just identify problems.

## 3. Teamwork and Collaboration

A building project involves architects, structural engineers, M&E engineers, quantity surveyors, contractors, and clients — all working toward the same goal. Engineers who can collaborate across disciplines are invaluable.

## 4. Time Management

Managing multiple tasks, meeting deadlines, and prioritising effectively is essential on any construction project. An engineer who consistently delivers on time builds trust with both employers and clients.

## 5. Leadership and Initiative

Even at the graduate level, employers look for engineers who take initiative — who notice problems before they're told, who suggest improvements, and who can lead a small team when required.

## How ERA Develops These Skills

Our programme dedicates a full module to soft skills development, including:
- Professional communication workshops
- Presentation and report writing practice
- Team-based project simulations
- Leadership and conflict resolution training

These skills complement the technical training and are a key reason our graduates are so successful in their placements.8:["$","$L13",null,{"children":["$","$L14",null,{"post":{"id":2,"slug":"soft-skills-every-engineer-needs","title":"Soft Skills Every Engineer Needs in 2026","excerpt":"Technical skills get you in the door — soft skills keep you there.
