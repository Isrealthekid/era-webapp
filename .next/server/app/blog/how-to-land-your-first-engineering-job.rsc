15:T7f3,## The Reality for Fresh Engineering Graduates

Every year, thousands of civil, mechanical, and electrical engineering graduates enter the Nigerian job market. The competition is fierce, and many graduates spend months — sometimes years — searching for their first role.

But it doesn't have to be that way.

## Step 1: Get Practical Experience Before You Graduate

The single biggest differentiator between graduates who get hired quickly and those who don't is **practical experience**. Employers in the building and construction industry want engineers who can read drawings, understand site processes, and communicate effectively with contractors.

At ERA, our internship placement programme connects participants directly with construction firms, giving them the real-world exposure that employers demand.

## Step 2: Learn Industry Software

AutoCAD, Revit, MS Project, and Primavera are not optional — they're baseline expectations. If you graduated without proficiency in at least one of these tools, invest in a short course immediately.

## Step 3: Build a Portfolio

Even without formal work experience, you can build a portfolio:
- Document your final year project with professional photos and drawings
- Volunteer on community building projects
- Create sample structural calculations or site reports

## Step 4: Network Within the Industry

Attend industry events, join professional bodies (NSE, COREN), and connect with practising engineers on LinkedIn. Many engineering jobs in Nigeria are filled through referrals, not advertisements.

## Step 5: Apply Strategically

Don't send the same generic CV to every company. Research each firm, understand their project portfolio, and tailor your application to show how your skills match their needs.

## The ERA Advantage

Our six-month programme is designed to make you employment-ready. With hands-on training, mentorship from practising engineers, and direct placement with our 20+ partner companies, ERA graduates achieve a 95% employment rate within three months.8:["$","$L13",null,{"children":["$","$L14",null,{"post":{"id":1,"slug":"how-to-land-your-first-engineering-job","title":"How to Land Your First Engineering Job in Nigeria","excerpt":"Practical steps every fresh graduate should take to stand out in a competitive market — from CV writing to site interview tips.","content":"$15","category":"Career","author":"ERA Editorial Team","authorAvatar":"/placeholder.svg","coverImage":"/placeholder.svg","date":"2026-01-15","tags":["career","engineering","graduates","employment"],"published":true}}]}]
